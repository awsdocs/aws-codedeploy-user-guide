# Create an AWS Lambda Compute Platform deployment \(console\)<a name="deployments-create-console-lambda"></a>

This topic shows you how to deploy a Lambda function using the console\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodeDeploy console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codedeploy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy)\.
**Note**  
Sign in with the same user that you set up in [Getting started with CodeDeploy](getting-started-codedeploy.md)\.

1. Do one of the following:
   +  If you want to deploy an application, in the navigation pane, expand **Deploy**, and then choose **Applications**\. Choose the name of the application you want to deploy\. Make sure the **Compute platform** column for your application is **AWS Lambda**\.
   +  If you want to redeploy a deployment, in the navigation pane, expand **Deploy**, and then choose **Deployments**\. Choose the deployment you want to redeploy, and in the **Application** column, choose the name of its application\. Make sure the **Compute platform** column for your deployment is **AWS Lambda**\.

1. On the **Deployments** tab, choose **Create deployment**\.
**Note**  
Your application must have a deployment group before it can be deployed\. If your application does not have a deployment group, on the **Deployment groups** tab, choose **Create deployment group**\. For more information, see [Create a deployment group with CodeDeploy](deployment-groups-create.md)\. 

1. In **Deployment group**, choose a deployment group to use for this deployment\.

1. Next to **Revision location**, choose where your revision is located:
   + **My application is stored in Amazon S3** — For information, see [Specify information about a revision stored in an Amazon S3 bucket](deployments-create-console-s3.md), and then return to step 6\. 
   + **Use AppSpec editor** — Select either JSON or YAML, and then enter your AppSpec file into the editor\. You can save the AppSpec file by choosing **Save as text file**\. When you choose **Deploy** at the end of these steps, you receive an error if your JSON or YAML is not valid\. For more information about creating an AppSpec file, see [Add an application specification file to a revision for CodeDeploy](application-revisions-appspec-file.md)\. 

1. \(Optional\) In **Deployment description**, enter a description for this deployment\.

1. \(Optional\) Expand **Deployment group overrides** to choose a deployment configuration to control how traffic is shifted to the Lambda function version that is different from the one specified in the deployment group\.

   For more information, see [ Deployment configurations on an AWS Lambda compute platform](deployment-configurations.md#deployment-configuration-lambda)\.

1. \(Optional\) In **Rollback configuration overrides**, you can specify different automatic rollback options for this deployment than were specified for the deployment group, if any\.

   For information about rollbacks in CodeDeploy, see [Redeployments and deployment rollbacks](deployment-steps-lambda.md#deployment-rollback-lambda) and [Redeploy and roll back a deployment with CodeDeploy](deployments-rollback-and-redeploy.md)\.

   Choose from the following:
   + **Roll back when a deployment fails** — CodeDeploy redeploys the last known good revision as a new deployment\.
   + **Roll back when alarm thresholds are met** — If alarms were added to the deployment group, CodeDeploy redeploys the last known good revision when one or more of the specified alarms is activated\.
   + **Disable rollbacks** — Do not perform rollbacks for this deployment\.

1. Choose **Create deployment**\. 

   To track the status of your deployment, see [View CodeDeploy deployment details ](deployments-view-details.md)\.
