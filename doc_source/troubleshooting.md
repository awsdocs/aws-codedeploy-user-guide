# Troubleshooting CodeDeploy<a name="troubleshooting"></a>

Use the topics in this section to help solve problems and errors you might encounter when using CodeDeploy\.

**Note**  
You can identify the causes of many deployment failures by reviewing the log files created during the deployment process\. For simplicity, we recommend using Amazon CloudWatch Logs to centrally monitor log files instead of viewing them instance by instance\. For information, see [View CodeDeploy Logs in CloudWatch Logs Console](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/view-aws-codedeploy-logs-in-amazon-cloudwatch-console/)\.
