To use the CodeDeploy console to view deployment details:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodeDeploy console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codedeploy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy)\.
**Note**  
Sign in with the same account or IAM user information that you used in [Getting Started with CodeDeploy](getting-started-codedeploy.md)\.

1. In the navigation pane, expand **Deploy**, and then choose **Deployments**\.
**Note**  
If no entries are displayed, make sure the correct region is selected\. On the navigation bar, in the region selector, choose one of the regions listed in [Region and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#codedeploy_region) in the *AWS General Reference*\. CodeDeploy is supported in these regions only\.

1. To see more details for a single deployment, in **Deployment history**, choose the deployment ID or choose the button next to the deployment ID, and then choose **View**\.

## View Deployment Details \(CLI\)<a name="deployments-view-details-cli"></a>

To use the AWS CLI to view deployment details, call the `get-deployment` command or the `batch-get-deployments` command\. You can call the `list-deployments` command to get a list of unique deployment IDs to use as inputs to the `get-deployment` command and the `batch-get-deployments` command\.

To view details about a single deployment, call the [get\-deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/get-deployment.html) command, specifying the unique deployment identifier\. To get the deployment ID, call the [list\-deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/list-deployments.html) command\.

To view details about multiple deployments, call the [batch\-get\-deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/batch-get-deployments.html) command, specifying multiple unique deployment identifiers\. To get the deployment IDs, call the [list\-deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/list-deployments.html) command\.

To view a list of deployment IDs, call the [list\-deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/list-deployments.html) command, specifying:
+ The name of the application associated with the deployment\. To view a list of application names, call the [list\-applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/list-applications.html) command\.
+ The name of the deployment group associated with the deployment\. To view a list of deployment group names, call the [list\-deployment\-groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/list-deployment-groups.html) command\.
+ Optionally, whether to include details about deployments by their deployment status\. \(If not specified, all matching deployments will be listed, regardless of their deployment status\.\)
