Before you start this tutorial, you must complete the prerequisites in [Getting started with CodeDeploy](getting-started-codedeploy.md), which include configuring your IAM user, installing or upgrading the AWS CLI, and creating a service role\. You do not have to create an IAM instance profile as described in the prerequisites\. On\-premises instances do not use IAM instance profiles\.

The physical device you will configure as an on\-premises instance must be running one of the operating systems listed in [Operating systems supported by the CodeDeploy agent](codedeploy-agent.md#codedeploy-agent-supported-operating-systems)\.
