# Add an Application Specification File to a Revision for AWS CodeDeploy<a name="application-revisions-appspec-file"></a>

This topic shows how to add an AppSpec file to your deployment\. It also includes templates to create an AppSpec file for an AWS Lambda and EC2/On\-Premises deployment\.

**Topics**
+ [Add an AppSpec File for an Amazon ECS Deployment](#add-appspec-file-ecs)
+ [Add an AppSpec File for an AWS Lambda Deployment](#add-appspec-file-lambda)
+ [Add an AppSpec File for an EC2/On\-Premises Deployment](#add-appspec-file-server)

## Add an AppSpec File for an Amazon ECS Deployment<a name="add-appspec-file-ecs"></a>

For a deployment to an Amazon ECS compute platform:
+ The AppSpec file specifies the Amazon ECS task definition used for the deployment, a container name and port mapping used to route traffic, and optional Lambda functions run after deployment lifecycle events\.
+ A revision is the same as an AppSpec file\.
+ An AppSpec file can be written using JSON or YAML\.
+ An AppSpec file can be saved as a text file or entered directly into a console when you create a deployment\. For more information, see [ Create an Amazon ECS Compute Platform Deployment \(Console\) ](deployments-create-console-ecs.md)\.

**To create an AppSpec file**

1. Copy the JSON or YAML template into a text editor or into the AppSpec editor in the console\.

1. Modify the template as needed\.

1. Use a JSON or YAML validator to validate your AppSpec file\. If you use the AppSpec editor, the file is validated when you choose **Create deployment**\.

1. If you use a text editor, save the file\. If you use the AWS CLI to create your deployment, reference the AppSpec file if it's on your hard drive or in an Amazon S3 bucket\. If you use the console, you must push your AppSpec file to Amazon S3\.

### YAML AppSpec File Template for an Amazon ECS Deployment with Instructions<a name="app-spec-template-yaml-ecs"></a>

## Add an AppSpec File for an AWS Lambda Deployment<a name="add-appspec-file-lambda"></a>

For a deployment to an AWS Lambda compute platform:
+ The AppSpec file contains instructions about the Lambda functions to be deployed and used for deployment validation\.
+ A revision is the same as an AppSpec file\.
+ An AppSpec file can be written using JSON or YAML\.
+ An AppSpec file can be saved as a text file or entered directly into a console AppSpec editor when creating a deployment\. For more information, see [Create an AWS Lambda Compute Platform Deployment \(Console\)](deployments-create-console-lambda.md)\.

To create an AppSpec file:

1. Copy the JSON or YAML template into a text editor or into the AppSpec editor in the console\.

1. Modify the template as needed\.

1. Use a JSON or YAML validator to validate your AppSpec file\. If you use the AppSpec editor, the file is validated when you choose **Create deployment**\.

1. If you use a text editor, save the file\. If you use the AWS CLI to create your deployment, reference the AppSpec file if it's on your hard drive or in an Amazon S3 bucket\. If you use the console, you must push your AppSpec file to Amazon S3\.

## Add an AppSpec File for an EC2/On\-Premises Deployment<a name="add-appspec-file-server"></a>

Without an AppSpec file, AWS CodeDeploy cannot map the source files in your application revision to their destinations or run scripts for your deployment to an EC2/On\-Premises compute platform, \.

Each revision must contain only one AppSpec file\. 

To add an AppSpec file to a revision:

1. Copy the template into a text editor\.

1. Modify the template as needed\.

1. Use a YAML validator to check the validity of your AppSpec file\. 

1. Save the file as `appspec.yml` in the root directory of the revision\.

1. Run one of the following commands to verify that you have placed your AppSpec file in the root directory:
   + For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

     ```
     find /path/to/root/directory -name appspec.yml
     ```

     There will be no output if the AppSpec file is not found there\.
   + For Windows:

     ```
     dir path\to\root\directory\appspec.yml
     ```

     A **File Not Found** error will be displayed if the AppSpec file is not stored there\.

1. Push the revision to Amazon S3 or GitHub\. 

   For instructions, see [Push a Revision for AWS CodeDeploy to Amazon S3 \(EC2/On\-Premises Deployments Only\)](application-revisions-push.md)\.

### AppSpec File Template for an EC2/On\-Premises Deployment with Instructions<a name="app-spec-template-server"></a>

**Note**  
 Deployments to Windows Server instances do not support the `runas` element\. If you are deploying to Windows Server instances, do not include it in your AppSpec file\.

#   the default is 1800 seconds (30 minutes).
#   Note that the maximum amount of time that all scripts must finish executing 
#   for each individual deployment lifecycle event is 3600 seconds (1 hour). 
#   Otherwise, the deployment will stop and AWS CodeDeploy will consider the deployment
#   to have failed to the Amazon EC2 instance. Make sure that the total number of seconds 
#   that are specified in "timeout" for all scripts in each individual deployment 
#   lifecycle event does not exceed a combined 3600 seconds (1 hour).
# For deployments to Amazon Linux, Ubuntu Server, or RHEL instances,
#   you can specify "runas" in an event to

#   If you are deploying to Windows Server instances,
#   remove "runas" altogether.
# If you do not want to run any commands during a particular deployment
#   lifecycle event, remove that event declaration altogether. Blank or
