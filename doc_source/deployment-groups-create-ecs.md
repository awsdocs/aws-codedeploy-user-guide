# Create a deployment group for an Amazon ECS deployment \(console\)<a name="deployment-groups-create-ecs"></a>

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodeDeploy console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codedeploy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy)\.
**Note**  
Sign in with the same user that you set up in [Getting started with CodeDeploy](getting-started-codedeploy.md)\.

1. In the navigation pane, expand **Deploy**, then choose **Applications**\.

1.  From the **Applications table**, choose the name of the application associated with the deployment group you want to edit\. 

1.  On your application page, from **Deployment groups**, choose the name of the deployment group you want to edit\. 

1. On your application page, from the **Deployment groups** tab, choose **Create deployment group**\. For more information about what you need to create a deployment group for an Amazon ECS deployment, see [Before you begin an Amazon ECS deployment](deployment-steps-ecs.md#deployment-steps-prerequisites-ecs)\. 

1. In **Deployment group name**, enter a name that describes the deployment group\.
**Note**  
If you want to use the same settings used in another deployment group \(including the deployment group name and the deployment configuration\), choose those settings on this page\. Although this new group and the existing group might have the same name, CodeDeploy treats them as separate deployment groups, because each is associated with a separate application\.

1. In **Service role**, choose a service role that grants CodeDeploy access to Amazon ECS\. For more information, see [Step 2: Create a service role for CodeDeploy](getting-started-create-service-role.md)\.

1.  From **Load balancer name**, choose the name of the load balancer that serves traffic to your Amazon ECS service\. 

1.  From **Production listener port**, choose the port and protocol for the listener that serves production traffic to your Amazon ECS service\. 

1.  \(Optional\) From **Test listener port**, choose the port and protocol of a test listener that serves traffic to the replacement task set in your Amazon ECS service during deployment\. You can specify one or more Lambda funtions in the AppSpec file that run during the `AfterAllowTestTraffic` hook\. The functions can run validation tests\. If a validation test fails, a deployment rollback is triggered\. If the validation tests succeed, the next hook in the deployment lifecycle, `BeforeAllowTraffic`, is triggered\. If a test listener port is not specified, nothing happens during the `AfterAllowTestTraffic` hook\. For more information, see [AppSpec 'hooks' section for an Amazon ECS deployment](reference-appspec-file-structure-hooks.md#appspec-hooks-ecs)\. 

1. From **Target group 1 name** and **Target group 2 name**, choose the target groups used to route traffic during your deployment\. CodeDeploy binds one target group to your Amazon ECS service's original task set and the other to its replacement task set\. For more information, see [Target Groups for Your Application Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-target-groups.html)\. 

1.  Choose **Reroute traffic immediately** or **Specify when to reroute traffic** to determine when to reroute traffic to your updated Amazon ECS service\. 

    If you choose **Reroute traffic immediately**, then the deployment automatically reroutes traffic after the replacement task set is provisioned\. 

    If you choose **Specify when to reroute traffic**, then choose the number of days, hours, and minutes to wait after the replacement task set is successfully provisioned\. During this wait time, validation tests in Lambda functions specified in the AppSpec file are executed\. If the wait time expires before traffic is rerouted, then the deployment status changes to `Stopped`\. 

1.  For **Original revision termination**, choose the number of days, hours, and minutes to wait after a successful deployment before the original task set in your Amazon ECS service is terminated\. 

1. \(Optional\) In **Advanced**, configure any options you want to include in the deployment, such as Amazon SNS notification triggers, Amazon CloudWatch alarms, or automatic rollbacks\.
