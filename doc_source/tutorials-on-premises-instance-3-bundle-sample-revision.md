# Step 3: Bundle and Upload Your Application Revision to Amazon S3<a name="tutorials-on-premises-instance-3-bundle-sample-revision"></a>

Before you can deploy your application revision, you'll need to bundle the files, and then upload the file bundle to an Amazon S3 bucket\. Follow the instructions in [Create an Application with CodeDeploy](applications-create.md) and [Push a Revision for CodeDeploy to Amazon S3 \(EC2/On\-Premises Deployments Only\)](application-revisions-push.md)\. \(Although you can give the application and deployment group any name, we recommend you use `CodeDeploy-OnPrem-App` for the application name and `CodeDeploy-OnPrem-DG` for the deployment group name\.\) After you have completed those instructions, return to this page\. 

**Note**  
Alternatively, you can upload the file bundle to a GitHub repository and deploy it from there\. For more information, see [Integrating CodeDeploy with GitHub](integrations-partners-github.md)\.
