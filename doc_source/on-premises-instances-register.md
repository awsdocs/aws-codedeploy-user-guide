# Register an on\-premises instance with CodeDeploy<a name="on-premises-instances-register"></a>

To register an on\-premises instance, you must use an IAM identity to authenticate your requests\. You can choose from the following options for the IAM identity and registration method you use:
+ Use an IAM role ARN to authenticate requests\. 
  + Use the [register\-on\-premises\-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/register-on-premises-instance.html) command and periodically refreshed temporary credentials generated with the AWS Security Token Service \(AWS STS\) to manually configure most registration options\. This option offers the highest level of security, because authentication occurs using a temporary token that times out and must be refreshed periodically\. This option is recommended for production deployments of any size\. For information, see [Use the register\-on\-premises\-instance command \(IAM Session ARN\) to register an on\-premises instance](register-on-premises-instance-iam-session-arn.md)\.
+ \(Not recommended\) Use an IAM user ARN to authenticate requests\.
  + Use the [register](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/register.html) command for the most automated registration process\. This option should only be used for non\-production deployments where security is less of a concern\. This option is less secure because it uses static \(permanent\) credentials for authentication\. This option works well for registering a single on\-premises instance\. For information, see [Use the register command \(IAM user ARN\) to register an on\-premises instance](instances-on-premises-register-instance.md)\. 
  + Use the [register\-on\-premises\-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/register-on-premises-instance.html) command to manually configure most registration options\. Suitable for registering a small number of on\-premises instances\. For information, see [Use the register\-on\-premises\-instance command \(IAM user ARN\) to register an on\-premises instance](register-on-premises-instance-iam-user-arn.md)\.
