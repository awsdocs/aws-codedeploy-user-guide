# Step 4: Create an IAM instance profile for your Amazon EC2 instances<a name="getting-started-create-iam-instance-profile"></a>

**Note**  
 If you are using the Amazon ECS or AWS Lambda compute platform , skip this step\. Amazon ECS deployments deploy an Amazon ECS service, and AWS Lambda deployments deploy a serverless Lambda function version, so an instance profile for Amazon EC2 instances is not required\.

Your Amazon EC2 instances need permission to access the Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories where the applications are stored\. To launch Amazon EC2 instances that are compatible with CodeDeploy, you must create an additional IAM role, an *instance profile*\. These instructions show you how to create an IAM instance profile to attach to your Amazon EC2 instances\. This role gives CodeDeploy permission to access the Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories where your applications are stored\.

You can create an IAM instance profile with the AWS CLI, the IAM console, or the IAM APIs\.

**Note**  
You can attach an IAM instance profile to an Amazon EC2 instance as you launch it or to a previously launched instance\. For more information, see [Instance profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-usingrole-instanceprofile.html)\.

## Create an IAM instance profile for your Amazon EC2 instances \(CLI\)<a name="getting-started-create-iam-instance-profile-cli"></a>

In these steps, we assume you have already followed the instructions in the first three steps of [Getting started with CodeDeploy](getting-started-codedeploy.md)\.

1. On your development machine, create a text file named `CodeDeployDemo-EC2-Trust.json`\. Paste the following content, which allows Amazon EC2 to work on your behalf:

   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
               },
               "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

1. In the same directory, create a text file named `CodeDeployDemo-EC2-Permissions.json`\. Paste the following content:

   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Action": [
                   "s3:Get*",
                   "s3:List*"
               ],
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
**Note**  
We recommend that you restrict this policy to only those Amazon S3 buckets your Amazon EC2 instances must access\. Make sure to give access to the Amazon S3 buckets that contain the CodeDeploy agent\. Otherwise, an error might occur when the CodeDeploy agent is installed or updated on the instances\. To grant the IAM instance profile access to only some CodeDeploy resource kit buckets in Amazon S3, use the following policy, but remove the lines for buckets you want to prevent access to:  

   ```
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "s3:Get*",
           "s3:List*"
         ],
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::replace-with-your-s3-bucket-name/*",
           "arn:aws:s3:::aws-codedeploy-us-east-2/*",
           "arn:aws:s3:::aws-codedeploy-us-east-1/*",
           "arn:aws:s3:::aws-codedeploy-us-west-1/*",
           "arn:aws:s3:::aws-codedeploy-us-west-2/*",
           "arn:aws:s3:::aws-codedeploy-ca-central-1/*",
           "arn:aws:s3:::aws-codedeploy-eu-west-1/*",
           "arn:aws:s3:::aws-codedeploy-eu-west-2/*",
           "arn:aws:s3:::aws-codedeploy-eu-west-3/*",
           "arn:aws:s3:::aws-codedeploy-eu-central-1/*",
           "arn:aws:s3:::aws-codedeploy-ap-east-1/*",
           "arn:aws:s3:::aws-codedeploy-ap-northeast-1/*",
           "arn:aws:s3:::aws-codedeploy-ap-northeast-2/*",
           "arn:aws:s3:::aws-codedeploy-ap-southeast-1/*",        
           "arn:aws:s3:::aws-codedeploy-ap-southeast-2/*",
           "arn:aws:s3:::aws-codedeploy-ap-southeast-4/*",
           "arn:aws:s3:::aws-codedeploy-ap-south-1/*",
           "arn:aws:s3:::aws-codedeploy-sa-east-1/*"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
**Note**  
If you want to use [ IAM authorization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-authorization) or Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\) endpoints with CodeDeploy, you will need to add more permissions\. See [Use CodeDeploy with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints) for more information\.

1. From the same directory, call the create\-role command to create an IAM role named **CodeDeployDemo\-EC2\-Instance\-Profile**, based on the information in the first file:
**Important**  
Be sure to include `file://` before the file name\. It is required in this command\.

   ```
   aws iam create-role --role-name CodeDeployDemo-EC2-Instance-Profile --assume-role-policy-document file://CodeDeployDemo-EC2-Trust.json
   ```

1. From the same directory, call the put\-role\-policy command to give the role named **CodeDeployDemo\-EC2\-Instance\-Profile** the permissions based on the information in the second file:
**Important**  
Be sure to include `file://` before the file name\. It is required in this command\.

   ```
   aws iam put-role-policy --role-name CodeDeployDemo-EC2-Instance-Profile --policy-name CodeDeployDemo-EC2-Permissions --policy-document file://CodeDeployDemo-EC2-Permissions.json
   ```

1. Call the attach\-role\-policy to give the role Amazon EC2 Systems Manager permissions so that SSM can install the CodeDeploy agent\. This policy is not needed if you plan to install the agent from the public Amazon S3 bucket with the command line\. Learn more about [ installing the CodeDeploy agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/codedeploy-agent-operations-install.html)\. 

   ```
   aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore --role-name CodeDeployDemo-EC2-Instance-Profile
   ```

1. Call the create\-instance\-profile command followed by the add\-role\-to\-instance\-profile command to create an IAM instance profile named **CodeDeployDemo\-EC2\-Instance\-Profile**\. The instance profile allows Amazon EC2 to pass the IAM role named **CodeDeployDemo\-EC2\-Instance\-Profile** to an Amazon EC2 instance when the instance is first launched:

   ```
   aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name CodeDeployDemo-EC2-Instance-Profile
   aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --instance-profile-name CodeDeployDemo-EC2-Instance-Profile --role-name CodeDeployDemo-EC2-Instance-Profile
   ```

   If you need to get the name of the IAM instance profile, see [list\-instance\-profiles\-for\-role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/list-instance-profiles-for-role.html) in the IAM section of the *AWS CLI Reference*\.

You've now created an IAM instance profile to attach to your Amazon EC2 instances\. For more information, see [IAM roles for Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*\.

## Create an IAM instance profile for your Amazon EC2 instances \(console\)<a name="getting-started-create-iam-instance-profile-console"></a>

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the IAM console, in the navigation pane, choose **Policies**, and then choose **Create policy**\. \(If a **Get Started** button appears, choose it, and then choose **Create Policy**\.\)

1. On the **Create policy** page, paste the following in the **JSON** tab:

   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Action": [
                   "s3:Get*",
                   "s3:List*"
               ],
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
**Note**  
We recommend that you restrict this policy to only those Amazon S3 buckets your Amazon EC2 instances must access\. Make sure to give access to the Amazon S3 buckets that contain the CodeDeploy agent\. Otherwise, an error might occur when the CodeDeploy agent is installed or updated on the instances\.

See [Use CodeDeploy with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints) for more information\.

1.  Choose **Review policy**\. 

1. On the **Create policy** page, type **CodeDeployDemo\-EC2\-Permissions** in the **Policy Name** box\.

1.  \(Optional\) For **Description**, type a description for the policy\. 

1. Choose **Create Policy**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**, and then choose **Create role**\.
