# Monitoring Deployments with Amazon SNS Event Notifications<a name="monitoring-sns-event-notifications"></a>

You can add triggers to a CodeDeploy deployment group to receive notifications about events related to deployments or instances in that deployment group\. These notifications are sent to recipients who are subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic you have made part of the trigger's action\. 

You can receive notifications for CodeDeploy events in SMS messages or email messages\. You can also use the JSON data that is created when a specified event occurs in other ways, such as sending messages to Amazon SQS queues or invoking a function in AWS Lambda\. For a look at the structure of the JSON data provided for deployment and instance triggers, see [JSON Data Formats for CodeDeploy Triggers](monitoring-sns-event-notifications-json-format.md)\.

You might choose to use triggers to receive notifications if:
+ You are a developer who needs to know when a deployment fails or stops so you can troubleshoot it\.
+ You are a system administrator who needs to know how many instances fail in order to monitor the health of your Amazon EC2 fleet\.
+ You are a manager who wants an at\-a\-glance count of deployment and instance events, which you can get through filtering rules that route different types of notifications into folders in your desktop email client\. 

You can create up to 10 triggers for each CodeDeploy deployment group, for any of the following event types\.


| Deployment events | Instance events |
