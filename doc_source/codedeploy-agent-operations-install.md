# Install the CodeDeploy agent<a name="codedeploy-agent-operations-install"></a>

To use CodeDeploy on EC2 instances or on\-premises servers, the CodeDeploy agent must be installed first\. We recommend installing and updating the CodeDeploy agent with AWS Systems Manager\. For more information about Systems Manager, see [What is AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.html)\. You can set up installation and scheduled updates of the CodeDeploy agent with Systems Manager in the console when you create your deployment groups\.

You can also install the CodeDeploy agent directly from an S3 bucket with the command line\.

For the recommended version to install, see [Version history of the CodeDeploy agent](codedeploy-agent.md#codedeploy-agent-version-history)\.
