# Working with Amazon EC2 Instances for AWS CodeDeploy<a name="instances-ec2"></a>

An Amazon EC2 instance is a virtual computing environment that you create and configure using the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud service\. Amazon EC2 provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) cloud\. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need for your AWS CodeDeploy deployments\.

For more information about Amazon EC2, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/)\.

The instructions in this section show you how to create and configure Amazon EC2 instances for use in your AWS CodeDeploy deployments\.
