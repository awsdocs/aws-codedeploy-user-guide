# CodeDeploy Application Specification Files<a name="application-specification-files"></a>

An application specification file \(AppSpec file\), which is unique to CodeDeploy, is a [YAML](http://www.yaml.org)\-formatted or [JSON](http://www.json.org)\-formatted file\. The AppSpec file is used to manage each deployment as a series of lifecycle event hooks, which are defined in the file\.

For information about how to create a well\-formed AppSpec file, see [CodeDeploy AppSpec File Reference](reference-appspec-file.md)\.

## AppSpec Files on an Amazon ECS Compute Platform<a name="appspec-files-on-ecs-compute-platform"></a>

If your application uses the Amazon ECS compute platform, the AppSpec file can be formatted with either YAML or JSON\. It can also be typed directly into an editor in the console\. The AppSpec file is used to specify:
+ The name of the Amazon ECS service and the container name and port used to direct traffic to the new task set\.
+ The functions to be used as validation tests\.

You can run validation Lambda functions after deployment lifecycle events\. For more information, see [AppSpec 'hooks' Section for an Amazon ECS Deployment](reference-appspec-file-structure-hooks.md#appspec-hooks-ecs), [ AppSpec File Structure for Amazon ECS Deployments ](reference-appspec-file-structure.md#ecs-appspec-structure), and [ AppSpec File Example for an Amazon ECS Deployment ](reference-appspec-file-example.md#appspec-file-example-ecs)\.

## AppSpec Files on an AWS Lambda Compute Platform<a name="appspec-files-on-lambda-compute-platform"></a>

If your application uses the AWS Lambda compute platform, the AppSpec file can be formatted with either YAML or JSON\. It can also be typed directly into an editor in the console\. The AppSpec file is used to specify:
+ The AWS Lambda function version to deploy\.
+ The functions to be used as validation tests\.

You can run validation Lambda functions after deployment lifecycle events\. For more information, see [AppSpec 'hooks' Section for an AWS Lambda Deployment](reference-appspec-file-structure-hooks.md#appspec-hooks-lambda)\.

## AppSpec Files on an EC2/On\-Premises Compute Platform<a name="appspec-files-on-server-compute-platform"></a>

If your application uses the EC2/On\-Premises compute platform, the AppSpec file is always YAML\-formatted\. The AppSpec file is used to:
+ Map the source files in your application revision to their destinations on the instance\.
+ Specify custom permissions for deployed files\.
+ Specify scripts to be run on each instance at various stages of the deployment process\.

You can run scripts on an instance after many of the individual deployment lifecycle events\. CodeDeploy runs only those scripts specified in the file, but those scripts can call other scripts on the instance\. You can run any type of script as long as it is supported by the operating system running on the instances\. For more information, see [AppSpec 'hooks' Section for an EC2/On\-Premises Deployment](reference-appspec-file-structure-hooks.md#appspec-hooks-server)\. 

## How the CodeDeploy Agent Uses the AppSpec File<a name="application-specification-files-agent-usage"></a>

During deployment, the CodeDeploy agent looks up the name of the current event in the **hooks** section of the AppSpec file\. If the event is not found, the CodeDeploy agent moves on to the next step\. If the event is found, the CodeDeploy agent retrieves the list of scripts to execute\. The scripts are run sequentially, in the order in which they appear in the file\. The status of each script is logged in the CodeDeploy agent log file on the instance\. 

If a script runs successfully, it returns an exit code of 0 \(zero\)\.

**Note**  
 The CodeDeploy agent is not used in an AWS Lambda or an Amazon ECS deployment\. 

During the **Install** event, the CodeDeploy agent uses the mappings defined in the **files** section of the AppSpec file to determine which folders or files to copy from the revision to the instance\.

If the CodeDeploy agent installed on the operating system doesn't match what's listed in the AppSpec file, the deployment fails\.
