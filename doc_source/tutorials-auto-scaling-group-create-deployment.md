## To create the deployment \(CLI\)<a name="tutorials-auto-scaling-group-create-deployment-cli"></a>

1. Call the create\-application command to create an application named **SimpleDemoApp**:

   ```
   aws deploy create-application --application-name SimpleDemoApp
   ```

1. You should have already created a service role by following the instructions in [Step 2: Create a service role for CodeDeploy](getting-started-create-service-role.md)\. The service role will give CodeDeploy permission to access your Amazon EC2 instances to expand \(read\) their tags\. You will need the service role ARN\. To get the service role ARN, follow the instructions in [Get the service role ARN \(CLI\) ](getting-started-create-service-role.md#getting-started-get-service-role-cli)\.

1. Now that you have a service role ARN, call the create\-deployment\-group command to create a deployment group named **SimpleDemoDG**, associated with the application named **SimpleDemoApp**, using the Auto Scaling group named **CodeDeployDemo\-AS\-Group** and deployment configuration named **CodeDeployDefault\.OneAtATime**, with the specified service role ARN\.
**Note**  
The [create\-deployment\-group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/create-deployment-group.html) command provides support for creating triggers that result in the sending of Amazon SNS notifications to topic subscribers about specified events in deployments and instances\. The command also supports options for automatically rolling back deployments and setting up alarms to stop deployments when monitoring thresholds in Amazon CloudWatch alarms are met\. Commands for these actions are not included in this tutorial\.

   On local Linux, macOS, or Unix machines:

   ```
   aws deploy create-deployment-group \
     --application-name SimpleDemoApp \
     --auto-scaling-groups CodeDeployDemo-AS-Group \
     --deployment-group-name SimpleDemoDG \
     --deployment-config-name CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime \
     --service-role-arn service-role-arn
   ```

   On local Windows machines:

   ```
   aws deploy create-deployment-group --application-name SimpleDemoApp --auto-scaling-groups CodeDeployDemo-AS-Group --deployment-group-name SimpleDemoDG --deployment-config-name CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime --service-role-arn service-role-arn
   ```

1. Call the create\-deployment command to create a deployment associated with the application named **SimpleDemoApp**, the deployment configuration named **CodeDeployDefault\.OneAtATime**, the deployment group named **SimpleDemoDG**, using the revision at the specified location\.

   **For Amazon Linux and RHEL Amazon EC2 instances, calling from local Linux, macOS, or Unix machines**

    

   ```
   aws deploy create-deployment \
     --application-name SimpleDemoApp \
     --deployment-config-name CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime \
     --deployment-group-name SimpleDemoDG \
     --s3-location bucket=bucket-name,bundleType=zip,key=samples/latest/SampleApp_Linux.zip
   ```

   *bucket\-name* is the name of the Amazon S3 bucket that contains the CodeDeploy Resource Kit files for your region\. For example, for the US East \(Ohio\) Region, replace *bucket\-name* with `aws-codedeploy-us-east-2`\. For a list of bucket names, see [Resource kit bucket names by Region](resource-kit.md#resource-kit-bucket-names)\.

   **For Amazon Linux and RHEL Amazon EC2 instances, calling from local Windows machines**

    

   ```
   aws deploy create-deployment --application-name SimpleDemoApp --deployment-config-name CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime --deployment-group-name SimpleDemoDG --s3-location bucket=bucket-name,bundleType=zip,key=samples/latest/SampleApp_Linux.zip
   ```

   *bucket\-name* is the name of the Amazon S3 bucket that contains the CodeDeploy Resource Kit files for your region\. For example, for the US East \(Ohio\) Region, replace *bucket\-name* with `aws-codedeploy-us-east-2`\. For a list of bucket names, see [Resource kit bucket names by Region](resource-kit.md#resource-kit-bucket-names)\.

   **For Windows Server Amazon EC2 instances, calling from local Linux, macOS, or Unix machines**

    

   ```
   aws deploy create-deployment \
     --application-name SimpleDemoApp \
     --deployment-config-name CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime \
     --deployment-group-name SimpleDemoDG \
     --s3-location bucket=bucket-name,bundleType=zip,key=samples/latest/SampleApp_Windows.zip
   ```

   *bucket\-name* is the name of the Amazon S3 bucket that contains the CodeDeploy Resource Kit files for your region\. For example, for the US East \(Ohio\) Region, replace *bucket\-name* with `aws-codedeploy-us-east-2`\. For a list of bucket names, see [Resource kit bucket names by Region](resource-kit.md#resource-kit-bucket-names)\.

   **For Windows Server Amazon EC2 instances, calling from local Windows machines**

   ```
   aws deploy create-deployment --application-name SimpleDemoApp --deployment-config-name CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime --deployment-group-name SimpleDemoDG --s3-location bucket=bucket-name,bundleType=zip,key=samples/latest/SampleApp_Windows.zip
   ```

   *bucket\-name* is the name of the Amazon S3 bucket that contains the CodeDeploy Resource Kit files for your region\. For example, for the US East \(Ohio\) Region, replace *bucket\-name* with `aws-codedeploy-us-east-2`\. For a list of bucket names, see [Resource kit bucket names by Region](resource-kit.md#resource-kit-bucket-names)\.
**Note**  
Currently, CodeDeploy does not provide a sample revision to deploy to Ubuntu Server Amazon EC2 instances\. To create a revision on your own, see [Working with application revisions for CodeDeploy](application-revisions.md)\.

1. Call the get\-deployment command to make sure the deployment was successful\.

   Before you call this command, you will need the ID of the deployment, which should have been returned by the call to the create\-deployment command\. If you need to get the deployment ID again, call the list\-deployments command against the application named **SimpleDemoApp** and the deployment group named **SimpleDemoDG**:

   ```
   aws deploy list-deployments --application-name SimpleDemoApp --deployment-group-name SimpleDemoDG --query "deployments" --output text
   ```

   Now, call the get\-deployment command using the deployment ID:

   ```
   aws deploy get-deployment --deployment-id deployment-id --query "deploymentInfo.status" --output text
   ```

   Do not continue until the returned value is `Succeeded`\.

## To create the deployment \(console\)<a name="tutorials-auto-scaling-group-create-deployment-console"></a>

1. You should have already created a service role by following the instructions in [Step 2: Create a service role for CodeDeploy](getting-started-create-service-role.md)\. The service role will give CodeDeploy permission to access your instances to expand \(read\) their tags\. Before you use the CodeDeploy console to deploy your application revision, you will need the service role ARN\. To get the service role ARN, follow the instructions in [Get the service role ARN \(console\) ](getting-started-create-service-role.md#getting-started-get-service-role-console)\. 

1. Now that you have the service role ARN, you can use the CodeDeploy console to deploy your application revision\.

   Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodeDeploy console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codedeploy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy)\.
**Note**  
Sign in with the same user that you set up in [Getting started with CodeDeploy](getting-started-codedeploy.md)\.
