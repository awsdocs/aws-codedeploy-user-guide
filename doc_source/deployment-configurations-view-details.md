## View Deployment Configuration Details \(Console\)<a name="deployment-configurations-view-details-console"></a>

To use the CodeDeploy console to view a list of deployment configuration names:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodeDeploy console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codedeploy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy)\.
**Note**  
Sign in with the same account or IAM user information that you used in [Getting Started with CodeDeploy](getting-started-codedeploy.md)\.

1. In the navigation pane, expand **Deploy**, and choose **Deployment configurations**\.

    Here you can see the deployment configuration names and criteria for each deployment configuration\. 
**Note**  
If no entries are displayed, make sure the correct region is selected\. On the navigation bar, in the region selector, choose one of the regions listed in [Region and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#codedeploy_region) in the *AWS General Reference*\. CodeDeploy is supported in these regions only\.

## View Deployment Configuration \(CLI\)<a name="deployment-configurations-view-details-cli"></a>

To use the AWS CLI to view deployment configuration details, call either the `get-deployment-config` command or the `list-deployment-configs` command\.

To view details about a single deployment configuration, call the [get\-deployment\-config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/get-deployment-config.html) command, specifying the unique deployment configuration name\.

To view details about multiple deployment configurations, call the [list\-deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/list-deployments.html) command
