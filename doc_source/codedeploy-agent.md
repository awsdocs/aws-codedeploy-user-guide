# Working with the CodeDeploy agent<a name="codedeploy-agent"></a>

 The CodeDeploy agent is a software package that, when installed and configured on an instance, makes it possible for that instance to be used in CodeDeploy deployments\.

**Important**  
 The minimum supported version of the CodeDeploy agent is 1\.1\.0\. Use of an earlier CodeDeploy agent might cause deployments to fail\. 

**Note**  
 The CodeDeploy agent is required only if you deploy to an EC2/On\-Premises compute platform\. The agent is not required for deployments that use the Amazon ECS or AWS Lambda compute platform\. 

A configuration file is placed on the instance when the agent is installed\. This file is used to specify how the agent works\. This configuration file specifies directory paths and other settings for AWS CodeDeploy to use as it interacts with the instance\. You can change some of the configuration options in the file\. For information about working with the CodeDeploy agent configuration file, see [CodeDeploy agent configuration reference](reference-agent-configuration.md)\.

For more information about working with the CodeDeploy agent, such as steps for installing, updating, and verifying versions, see [Managing CodeDeploy agent operations](codedeploy-agent-operations.md)\.

## Communication protocol and port for the CodeDeploy agent<a name="codedeploy-agent-outbound-port"></a>

The CodeDeploy agent communicates outbound using HTTPS over port 443\.

When the CodeDeploy agent runs on an EC2 instance, it will use the [EC2 metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html) endpoint to retrieve instance related information\. Find out more about [limiting and granting instance metadata service access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html#instance-metadata-limiting-access)\.

## Version history of the CodeDeploy agent<a name="codedeploy-agent-version-history"></a>

Your instances must be running a supported version of the CodeDeploy agent\. The current minimum supported version is 1\.1\.0\. If you are running an earlier version, deployments to your instances might fail\. 

The following table lists all releases of the CodeDeploy agent and the features and enhancements included with each version\.


| Version | Release date | Details | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  1\.4\.1  |  December 6, 2022  |  **Fixed**: Security vulnerability related to logging\. **Enhancement**: Improved logging when polling for the host command\.  | 
|  1\.4\.0  |  August 31, 2022  |  **Added**: Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8\.  **Added**: Support for long file paths on the CodeDeploy agent for Windows\. To enable long file paths, you'll need to set the appropriate Windows registry key and then restart your agent\. For more information, see [Long file paths cause "No such file or directory" errors](troubleshooting-deployments.md#troubleshooting-long-file-paths)\. **Fixed**: An issue with the unzip operation when the disk was full\. The CodeDeploy agent now detects the unzip's [exit code 50](https://linux.die.net/man/1/unzip) indicating a full disk, removes partially extracted files, and raises an exception to post a failure to the CodeDeploy server\. The error message is visible as a lifecycle event error message, and the host\-level deployment will stop without being stuck or timing\-out\. **Fixed**: An issue that would cause the agent to fail\. **Fixed**: An issue where hooks would time out during an edge\-case race condition\. Hooks with no scripts will now continue and no longer cause failures or timeouts\.  **Changed**: The `update` script from the CodeDeploy agent's `bin` directory was removed because it is no longer used\. **Changed**: The CodeDeploy agent for Windows Server now bundles Ruby 2\.7\. **Changed**: New environment variables were added, to be used by hook scripts depending on the source of the deployment bundle \(Amazon S3 or GitHub\)\.  For more information, see [Environment variable availability for hooks](reference-appspec-file-structure-hooks.md#reference-appspec-file-structure-environment-variable-availability)\.  **Deprecation notice**: CodeDeploy agent 1\.4\.0 is the last release that will include installers for 32\-bit Windows Server\. **Deprecation notice**: CodeDeploy agent 1\.4\.0 is the last release that will support Windows Server 2008 R2\. **Removed**: Support for the CodeDeploy agent on the following Amazon EC2 AMIs: Amazon Linux 2014\.09, 2016\.03, 2016\.09, and 2017\.03\.   |

## Application revision and log file cleanup<a name="codedeploy-agent-revisions-logs-cleanup"></a>

The CodeDeploy agent archives revisions and log files on instances\. The CodeDeploy agent cleans up these artifacts to conserve disk space\.

**Application revision deployment logs**: You can use the **:max\_revisions:** option in the agent configuration file to specify the number of application revisions to archive by entering any positive integer\. CodeDeploy also archives the log files for those revisions\. All others are deleted, with the exception of the log file of the last successful deployment\. That log file is always retained, even if the number of failed deployments exceeds the number of retained revisions\. If no value is specified, CodeDeploy retains the five most recent revisions in addition to the currently deployed revision\. 

**CodeDeploy logs**: For Amazon Linux, Ubuntu Server, and RHEL instances, the CodeDeploy agent rotates the log files under the `/var/log/aws/codedeploy-agent` folder\. The log file is rotated at 00:00:00 \(instance time\) daily\. Log files are deleted after seven days\. The naming pattern for rotated log files is `codedeploy-agent.YYYYMMDD.log`\.

## Files installed by the CodeDeploy agent<a name="codedeploy-agent-install-files"></a>

The CodeDeploy agent stores revisions, deployment history, and deployment scripts in its root directory on an instance\. The default name and location of this directory is:

`'/opt/codedeploy-agent/deployment-root'` for Amazon Linux, Ubuntu Server, and RHEL instances\.

`'C:\ProgramData\Amazon\CodeDeploy'` for Windows Server instances\. 

You can use the **root\_dir** setting in the CodeDeploy agent configuration file to configure the directory's name and location\. For more information, see [CodeDeploy agent configuration reference](reference-agent-configuration.md)\.

The following is an example of the file and directory structure under the root directory\. The structure assumes there are N number of deployment groups, and each deployment group contains N number of deployments\. 

```
|--deployment-root/
|-- deployment group 1 ID 
|    |-- deployment 1 ID 
|    |    |-- Contents and logs of the deployment's revision

```


+  **Deployment Group ID** folders represent each of your deployment groups\. A deployment group directory's name is its ID \(for example, `acde1916-9099-7caf-fd21-012345abcdef`\)\. Each deployment group directory contains one subdirectory for each attempted deployment in that deployment group\. 

   You can use the [batch\-get\-deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/batch-get-deployments.html) command to find a deployment group ID\.
+  **Deployment ID** folders represent each deployment in a deployment group\. Each deployment directory's name is its ID\. Each folder contains:
  +  **bundle\.tar**, a compressed file with the contents of the deployment's revision\. Use a zip decompression utility if you want to view the revision\.
  +  **deployment\-archive**, a directory that contains the contents of the deployment's revision\. 
  +  **logs**, a directory that contains a `scripts.log` file\. This file lists the output of all scripts specified in the deployment's AppSpec file\. 

   If you want to find the folder for a deployment but don't know its deployment ID or deployment group ID, you can use the [AWS CodeDeploy console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy) or the AWS CLI to find them\. For more information, see [View CodeDeploy deployment details ](deployments-view-details.md)\. 

   The default maximum number of deployments that can be archived in a deployment group is five\. When that number is reached, future deployments are archived and the oldest archive is deleted\. You can use the **max\_revisions** setting in the CodeDeploy agent configuration file to change the default\. For more information, see [CodeDeploy agent configuration reference](reference-agent-configuration.md)\. 
**Note**  
 If you want to recover hard disk space used by archived deployments, update the **max\_revisions** setting to a low number, such as 1 or 2\. The next deployment deletes archived deployments so that the number is equal to the you specified\. 
+  **deployment\-instructions** contains four text files for each deployment group: 
  + **\[Deployment Group ID\]\-cleanup**, a text file with an undo verison of each command that is run during a deployment\. An example file name is `acde1916-9099-7caf-fd21-012345abcdef-cleanup`\. 
  + **\[Deployment Group ID\]\-install\.json**, a JSON file created during the most recent deployment\. It contains the commands run during the deployment\. An example file name is `acde1916-9099-7caf-fd21-012345abcdef-install.json`\.
  + **\[Deployment Group ID\]\_last\_successfull\_install**, a text file that lists the archive directory of the last successful deployment\. This file is created when the CodeDeploy agent has copied all files in the deployment application to the instance\. It is used by the CodeDeploy agent during the next deployment to determine which `ApplicationStop` and `BeforeInstall` scripts to run\. An example file name is `acde1916-9099-7caf-fd21-012345abcdef_last_successfull_install`\.
  + **\[Deployment Group ID\]\_most\_recent\_install**, a text file that lists the name of the archive directory of the most recent deployment\. This file is created when the files in the deployment are successfully downloaded\. The \[deployment group ID\]\_last\_successfull\_install file is created after this file, when the downloaded files are copied to their final destination\. An example file name is `acde1916-9099-7caf-fd21-012345abcdef_most_recent_install`\.
+  **deployment\-logs** contains the following log files: 
  +  **codedeploy\-agent\.yyyymmdd\.log** files are created for each day there is a deployment\. Each log file contains information about the day's deployments\. These log files might be useful for debugging problems like a permissions issue\. The log file is initially named `codedeploy-agent.log`\. The next day, the date of its deployments is inserted into the file name\. For example, if today is January 3, 2018, you can see information about all of today's deployments in `codedeploy-agent.log`\. Tomorrow, on January 4, 2018, the log file is renamed `codedeploy-agent.20180103.log`\. 
  +  **codedeploy\-agent\-deployments\.log** compiles the contents of `scripts.log` files for each deployment\. The `scripts.log` files are located in the `logs` subfolder under each `Deployment ID` folder\. The entries in this file are preceded by a deployment ID\. For example, "`[d-ABCDEF123]LifecycleEvent - BeforeInstall`" might be written during a deployment with an ID of `d-ABCDEF123`\. When `codedeploy-agent-deployments.log` reaches its maximum size, the CodeDeploy agent continues to write to it while deleting old content\.
