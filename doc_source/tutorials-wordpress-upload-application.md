# Step 3: Upload Your WordPress Application to Amazon S3<a name="tutorials-wordpress-upload-application"></a>

Now you will prepare and upload your source content to a location from which CodeDeploy can deploy it\. The following instructions show you how to provision an Amazon S3 bucket, prepare the application revision's files for the bucket, bundle the revision's files, and then push the revision to the bucket\.

**Note**  
Although it's not covered in this tutorial, you can use CodeDeploy to deploy applications from GitHub repositories to instances\. For more information, see [Integrating CodeDeploy with GitHub](integrations-partners-github.md)\.

## Provision an Amazon S3 Bucket<a name="tutorials-wordpress-upload-application-create-s3-bucket"></a>

Create a storage container or *bucket* in Amazon S3â€”or use an existing bucket\. Make sure you can upload the revision to the bucket and that Amazon EC2 instances used in deployments can download the revision from the bucket\.

You can use the AWS CLI, the Amazon S3 console, or the Amazon S3 APIs to create an Amazon S3 bucket\. After you create the bucket, make sure to give access permissions to the bucket and your IAM user\.

**Note**  
Bucket names must be unique across Amazon S3 for all AWS accounts\. If you aren't able to use **codedeploydemobucket**, try a different bucket name, such as **codedeploydemobucket** followed by a dash and your initials or some other unique identifier\. Then be sure to substitute your bucket name for **codedeploydemobucket** wherever you see it throughout this tutorial\.  
The Amazon S3 bucket must be created in the same AWS region where your target Amazon EC2 instances are launched\. For example, if you create the bucket in the US East \(N\. Virginia\) Region, then your target Amazon EC2 instances must be launched in the US East \(N\. Virginia\) Region\.

### To create an Amazon S3 bucket \(CLI\)<a name="tutorials-wordpress-upload-application-create-s3-bucket-cli"></a>

Call the mb command to create an Amazon S3 bucket named **codedeploydemobucket**:

```
aws s3 mb s3://codedeploydemobucket
```

### To create an Amazon S3 bucket \(console\)<a name="tutorials-wordpress-upload-application-create-s3-bucket-console"></a>

1. Open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. In the Amazon S3 console, choose **Create bucket**\.

1. In the **Bucket name** box, type a name for the bucket\.

1. In the **Region** list, choose the target region, and then choose **Create**\.

### Give permissions to the Amazon S3 bucket and your IAM user<a name="tutorials-wordpress-upload-application-create-s3-bucket-grant-permissions"></a>

You must have permissions to upload to the Amazon S3 bucket\. You can specify these permissions through an Amazon S3 bucket policy\. For example, in the following Amazon S3 bucket policy, using the wildcard character \(\*\) allows AWS account `111122223333` to upload files to any directory in the Amazon S3 bucket named `codedeploydemobucket`:

```
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::codedeploydemobucket/*",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "111122223333"
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

To view your AWS account ID, see [Finding Your AWS Account ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html#FindingYourAWSId)\.

Now is a good time to verify the Amazon S3 bucket will allow download requests from each participating Amazon EC2 instance\. You can specify this through an Amazon S3 bucket policy\. For example, in the following Amazon S3 bucket policy, using the wildcard character \(\*\) allows any Amazon EC2 instance with an attached IAM instance profile containing the ARN `arn:aws:iam::80398EXAMPLE:role/CodeDeployDemo` to download files from any directory in the Amazon S3 bucket named `codedeploydemobucket`:

```
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::codedeploydemobucket/*",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::80398EXAMPLE:role/CodeDeployDemo"
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

 For information about how to generate and attach an Amazon S3 bucket policy, see [Bucket Policy Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html)\.

Your account must have permission to upload the revision to the Amazon S3 bucket\. One way to specify this is through an IAM policy\. The following custom IAM user policy allows your IAM user to upload revisions anywhere in the Amazon S3 bucket named `codedeploydemobucket`:

```
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",  
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action":["s3:PutObject"],
      "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::codedeploydemobucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

For information about how to create and attach an IAM policy, see [Working with Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/ManagingPolicies.html#AddingPermissions_Console)\.

## Prepare the Application's Files for the Bucket<a name="tutorials-wordpress-upload-application-prepare-application-files"></a>

Make sure the WordPress application files, the AppSpec file, and the scripts are organized on your development machine similar to the following:

```
/tmp/
  |--WordPress/
      |-- appspec.yml  
      |-- scripts/
      |    |-- change_permissions.sh
      |    |-- create_test_db.sh
      |    |-- install_dependencies.sh
      |    |-- start_server.sh
      |    |-- stop_server.sh
      |-- wp-admin/
      |    |-- (various files...)
      |-- wp-content/
      |    |-- (various files...)
      |-- wp-includes/
      |    |-- (various files...)
      |-- index.php
      |-- license.txt
      |-- readme.html
      |-- (various files ending with .php...)
```

## Bundle the Application's Files into a Single Archive File and Push the Archive File<a name="tutorials-wordpress-upload-application-bundle-and-push-archive"></a>

Bundle the WordPress application files and the AppSpec file into an archive file \(known as an application *revision*\)\.

**Note**  
You may be charged for storing objects in a bucket and for transferring application revisions into and out of a bucket\. For more information, see [Amazon S3 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/)\. 

1. On the development machine, switch to the folder where the files are stored: 

   ```
   cd /tmp/WordPress
   ```
**Note**  
If you don't switch to this folder, then the file bundling will start at your current folder\. For example, if your current folder is `/tmp` instead of `/tmp/WordPress`, then the bundling will start with files and subfolders in the `tmp` folder, which may include more than the `WordPress` subfolder\.

1. Call the create\-application command to register a new application named **WordPress\_App**:

   ```
   aws deploy create-application --application-name WordPress_App
   ```

1. Call the CodeDeploy [push](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/push.html) command to bundle the files together, upload the revisions to Amazon S3, and register information with CodeDeploy about the uploaded revision, all in one action\. 

   ```
   aws deploy push \
     --application-name WordPress_App \
     --s3-location s3://codedeploydemobucket/WordPressApp.zip \
     --ignore-hidden-files
   ```

   This command bundles the files from the current directory \(excluding any hidden files\) into a single archive file named **WordPressApp\.zip**, uploads the revision to the **codedeploydemobucket** bucket, and registers information with CodeDeploy about the uploaded revision\.
