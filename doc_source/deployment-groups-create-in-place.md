# Create a deployment group for an in\-place deployment \(console\)<a name="deployment-groups-create-in-place"></a>

To use the CodeDeploy console to create a deployment group for an in\-place deployment:

**Warning**  
Do not follow these steps if:  
You have not prepared your instances to be used in the first CodeDeploy deployment of an application\. To set up your instances, follow the instructions in [Working with instances for CodeDeploy](instances.md), and then follow the steps in this topic\.
You want to create a deployment group that uses a custom deployment configuration, but you have not yet created the deployment configuration\. Follow the instructions in [Create a deployment configuration with CodeDeploy](deployment-configurations-create.md), and then follow the steps in this topic\. 
You do not have a service role that trusts CodeDeploy with, at minimum, the trust and permissions described in [Step 2: Create a service role for CodeDeploy](getting-started-create-service-role.md)\. To create and configure a service role, follow the instructions in [Step 2: Create a service role for CodeDeploy](getting-started-create-service-role.md), and then follow the steps in this topic\.
You want to select a Classic Load Balancer, Application Load Balancer, or Network Load Balancer in Elastic Load Balancing for the in\-place deployment, but have not yet created it\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodeDeploy console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codedeploy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy)\.
**Note**  
Sign in with the same user that you set up in [Getting started with CodeDeploy](getting-started-codedeploy.md)\.

1. In the navigation pane, expand **Deploy**, then choose **Applications**\.

1. On the **Applications** page, choose the name of the application for which you want to create a deployment group\.

1. On your application page, from the **Deployment groups** tab, choose **Create deployment group**\.

1. In **Deployment group name**, enter a name that describes the deployment group\.
**Note**  
If you want to use the same settings used in another deployment group \(including the deployment group name; tags, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group names, or both; and the deployment configuration\), specify those settings on this page\. Although this new deployment group and the existing deployment group have the same name, CodeDeploy treats them as separate deployment groups, because they are each associated with separate applications\.

1. In **Service role**, choose a service role that grants CodeDeploy access to your target instance\.

1. In **Deployment type**, choose **In\-place**\.

1. In **Environment configuration**, select any of the following: 

   1. **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups**: Enter or choose the name of an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to deploy your application revision to\. When new Amazon EC2 instances are launched as part of an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group, CodeDeploy can deploy your revisions to the new instances automatically\. You can add up to 10 Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups to a deployment group\.

   1. **Amazon EC2 instances** or **On\-premises instances**: In the **Key** and **Value** fields, enter the values of the key\-value pair you used to tag the instances\. You can tag up to 10 key\-value pairs in a single tag group\.

      1. You can use wildcards in the **Value** field to identify all instances tagged in certain patterns, such as similar Amazon EC2 instance, cost center, and group names, and so on\. For example, if you choose **Name** in the **Key** field and enter **GRP\-\*a** in the **Value** field, CodeDeploy identifies all instances that fit that pattern, such as **GRP\-1a**, **GRP\-2a**, and **GRP\-XYZ\-a**\.

      1. The **Value** field is case sensitive\. 

      1. To remove a key\-value pair from the list, choose the remove icon\.

      As CodeDeploy finds instances that match each specified key\-value pair or Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group name, it displays the number of matching instances\. To see more information about the instances, click the number\.

      If you want to refine the criteria for the deployed\-to instances, choose **Add tag group** to create an tag group\. You can create up to three tag groups with up to 10 key\-value pairs each\. When you use multiple tag groups in a deployment group, only instances that are identified by all the tag groups are included in the deployment group\. That means an instance must match at least one of the tags in each of the groups to be included in the deployment group\.

      For information about using tag groups to refine your deployment group, see [Tagging instances for deployment groups in CodeDeploy](instances-tagging.md)\.

1. In **Agent configuration with Systems Manager**, specify how you would like to install and update the CodeDeploy agent on the instances in your deployment group\. For more information on the CodeDeploy agent, see [Working with the CodeDeploy agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/codedeploy/latest/userguide/codedeploy-agent.html)\. For more information about Systems Manager, see [What is Systems Manager?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.html)

   1. **Never**: Skip configuring the CodeDeploy installation with Systems Manager\. Instances must have the agent installed to be used in deployments, so only choose this option if you will install the CodeDeploy agent another way\.

   1. **Only once**: Systems Manager will install the CodeDeploy agent once on every instance in your deployment group\.

   1. **Now and schedule updates**: Systems Manager will create an association with State Manager that installs the CodeDeploy agent on the schedule you configure\. For more information about State Manager and associations, see [About State Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-state-about.html)\.

1. In **Deployment configuration**, choose a deployment configuration to control the rate at which instances are deployed to, such as one at a time or all at once\. For more information about deployment configurations, see [Working with deployment configurations in CodeDeploy](deployment-configurations.md)\.

1. \(Optional\) In **Load balancer**, select **Enable load balancing**, and then choose an existing Classic Load Balancer, Application Load Balancer, or Network Load Balancer to manage traffic to the instances during the deployment processes\.

   Each instance is deregistered from the load balancer \(Classic Load Balancers\) or target group \(Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers\) to prevent traffic from being routed to it during the deployment\. It is re\-registered when the deployment is complete\.

   For more information about load balancers for CodeDeploy deployments, see [Integrating CodeDeploy with Elastic Load Balancing](integrations-aws-elastic-load-balancing.md)\.
**Warning**  
If you are configuring both an Auto Scaling group and an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer in this deployment group, and you want to [attach the load balancer to the Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/attach-load-balancer-asg.html), we recommend completing this attachment *before* creating the CodeDeploy deployment from this deployment group\. Attempting to complete the attachment after creating the deployment may cause all the instances to become deregistered from the load balancer unexpectedly\.

1. \(Optional\) Expand **Advanced** and configure any options you want to include in the deployment, such as Amazon SNS notification triggers, Amazon CloudWatch alarms, or automatic rollbacks\.

   For more information, see [Configure advanced options for a deployment group](deployment-groups-configure-advanced-options.md)\. 

1. Choose **Create deployment group**\.
