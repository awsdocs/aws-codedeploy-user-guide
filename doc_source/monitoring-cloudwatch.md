# Monitoring deployments with Amazon CloudWatch tools<a name="monitoring-cloudwatch"></a>

You can monitor CodeDeploy deployments using the following CloudWatch tools: Amazon CloudWatch Events, CloudWatch alarms, and Amazon CloudWatch Logs\. 

Reviewing the logs created by the CodeDeploy agent and deployments can help you troubleshoot the causes of deployment failures\. As an alternative to reviewing CodeDeploy logs on one instance at a time, you can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor all logs in a central location\. 

For information about using the CloudWatch console to view CodeDeploy logs, see [View CodeDeploy logs in CloudWatch Logs console](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/view-aws-codedeploy-logs-in-amazon-cloudwatch-console/)\.

For information about using CloudWatch alarms and CloudWatch Events to monitor your CodeDeploy deployments, see the following topics\.
