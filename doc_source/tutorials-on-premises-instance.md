# Tutorial: Deploy an Application to an On\-Premises Instance with CodeDeploy \(Windows Server, Ubuntu Server, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux\)<a name="tutorials-on-premises-instance"></a>

This tutorial helps you gain experience with CodeDeploy by guiding you through the deployment of a sample application revision to a single on\-premises instance—that is, a physical device that is not an Amazon EC2 instance—running Windows Server, Ubuntu Server, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux \(RHEL\)\. For information about on\-premises instances and how they work with CodeDeploy, see [Working with On\-Premises Instances for CodeDeploy](instances-on-premises.md)\.
