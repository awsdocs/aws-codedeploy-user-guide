# Integration with partner products and services<a name="integrations-partners"></a>

CodeDeploy has built\-in integration for the following partner products and services:


|  |  | 
| --- |--- |
| Ansible |  If you already have a set of [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com) playbooks, but just need somewhere to run them, the template for Ansible and CodeDeploy demonstrates how a couple of simple deployment hooks can ensure Ansible is available on the local deployment instance and runs the playbooks\. If you already have a process for building and maintaining your inventory, there's also an Ansible module you can use to install and run the CodeDeploy agent\.

| Atlassian – Bamboo and Bitbucket |  The CodeDeploy task for [Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/) compresses the directory that contains an AppSpec file into a \.zip file, uploads the file to Amazon S3, and then starts the deployment according to the configuration provided in the CodeDeploy application\.  Atlassian Bitbucket support for CodeDeploy enables you to push code to Amazon EC2 instances directly from the Bitbucket UI, on demand, to any of your deployment groups\. This means that after you update code in your Bitbucket repository, you do not have to sign in to your continuous integration \(CI\) platform or Amazon EC2 instances to run a manual deployment process\.

| Chef |  AWS provides two template samples for integrating [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) and CodeDeploy\. The first is a Chef cookbook that installs and starts the CodeDeploy agent\. This allows you to continue managing your host infrastructure with Chef while using CodeDeploy\. The second sample template demonstrates how to use CodeDeploy to orchestrate the running of cookbooks and recipes with chef\-solo on each node\. Learn more: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-partners.html)  | 
| CircleCI |  [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) provides an automated testing and continuous integration and deployment toolset\. After you create an IAM role in AWS to use with CircleCI and configure your deployment parameters in your circle\.yml file, you can use CircleCI with CodeDeploy to create application revisions, upload them to an Amazon S3 bucket, and then initiate and monitor your deployments\. Learn more: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-partners.html)  | 
| CloudBees |  You can use the CodeDeploy Jenkins plugin, available on [CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com/) DEV@cloud, as a post\-build action\. For example, at the end of a continuous delivery pipeline, you can use it to deploy an application revision to your fleet of servers\. Learn more: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-partners.html)  | 
| Codeship |  You can use [Codeship](https://codeship.com/) to deploy application revisions through CodeDeploy\. You can use the Codeship UI to add CodeDeploy to a deployment pipeline for a branch\. Learn more:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-partners.html)  | 
| GitHub |  You can use CodeDeploy to deploy application revisions from [GitHub](http://www.github.com) repositories\. You can also trigger a deployment from a GitHub repository whenever the source code in that repository is changed\. Learn more: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-partners.html)  | 
|  **HashiCorp Consul**  |  You can use the open\-source HashiCorp Consul tool to help ensure the health and stability of your application environment when you deploy applications in CodeDeploy\. You can use Consul to register applications to be discovered during deployment, put applications and nodes in maintenance mode to omit them from deployments, and stop deployments if target instances become unhealthy\. Learn more: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-partners.html)  | 
| Jenkins |  The CodeDeploy [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) plugin provides a post\-build step for your Jenkins project\. Upon a successful build, it zips the workspace, uploads to Amazon S3, and starts a new deployment\. Learn more:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-partners.html)  | 
| Puppet Labs |  AWS provides sample templates for [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/) and CodeDeploy\. The first is a Puppet module that installs and starts the CodeDeploy agent\. This allows you to continue managing your host infrastructure with Puppet while using CodeDeploy\. The second sample template demonstrates how to use CodeDeploy to orchestrate the running of modules and manifests with a masterless puppet on each node\. Learn more:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-partners.html)  | 
| SaltStack |  You can integrate [SaltStack](http://saltstack.com/) infrastructure with CodeDeploy\. You can use the CodeDeploy module to install and run the CodeDeploy agent on your minions or, with a couple of simple deployment hooks, you can use CodeDeploy to orchestrate the running of your Salt States\. Learn more:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-partners.html)  | 
| Solano Labs |  After your build has passed its tests in Solano CI, a script runs to prepare your application for release\. The aws deploy push command packages and pushes your application through CodeDeploy, and then optionally deploys the application revision to a deployment group and confirms it has been deployed\. You can also set up automatic CodeDeploy deployments from your CI build\. Learn more:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-partners.html)  | 
|  **TeamCity**  |  You can use the CodeDeploy Runner plugin to deploy applications directly from TeamCity\. The plugin adds a TeamCity build step that prepares and uploads an application revision to an Amazon S3 bucket, registers the revision in a CodeDeploy application, creates a CodeDeploy deployment and, if you choose, waits for the deployment to be completed\. Learn more: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-partners.html)  | 
| Travis CI |  You can configure [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) to trigger a deployment in CodeDeploy after a successful build\. Learn more:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/integrations-partners.html)  |
