1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS CodeDeploy console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codedeploy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy)\.

1. On the AWS CodeDeploy menu, choose **Deployments**\. 
**Note**  
If no entries are displayed, make sure the correct region is selected\. On the navigation bar, in the region selector, choose one of the regions listed in [Region and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#codedeploy_region) in the *AWS General Reference*\. AWS CodeDeploy is supported in these regions only\.

1. In the **Actions** column for the deployment you want to stop, choose **Stop**\.
**Note**  
If a **Stop** button does not appear in the **Actions** column, the deployment has progressed to a point where it cannot be stopped\.
