# Delete an application in CodeDeploy<a name="applications-delete"></a>

You can use the CodeDeploy console, the AWS CLI, or a CodeDeploy API action to delete applications\. For information about using the CodeDeploy API action, see [DeleteApplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteApplication.html)\.

**Warning**  
Deleting an application removes information about the application from the CodeDeploy system, including all related deployment group information and deployment details\. Deleting an application created for an EC2/On\-Premises deployment does not remove any application revisions from instances nor does it delete revisions from Amazon S3 buckets\. Deleting an application created for an EC2/On\-Premises deployment does not terminate any Amazon EC2 instances or deregister any on\-premises instances\. This action cannot be undone\.
