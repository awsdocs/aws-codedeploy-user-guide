# Step 4: Use the CodeDeploy Console to Deploy Your Amazon ECS Service<a name="tutorial-ecs-with-hooks-deployment"></a>

 In this section, you update your deployment group by specifying the port for your test listener\. This is the listener you created in [ Step 1: Create a Test Listener ](tutorial-ecs-with-hooks-create-second-listener.md)\. During deployment, CodeDeploy runs your validation test during the `AfterAllowTestTraffic` deployment lifecycle hook using test traffic served to your replacement task set using the test listener\. Your validation test returns the result `Succeeded`, so the deployment proceeds with the next deployment lifecycle event\. In a real world scenario, your test function returns `Succeeded` or `Failed`\. 

**To add a test listener to your deployment group**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodeDeploy console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codedeploy/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/)\.

1. From the navigation pane, choose **Applications**\. 

1. Choose the application you created in [Tutorial: Deploy an Amazon ECS Service](tutorial-ecs-deployment.md)\. If you used the suggested name, it is **ecs\-demo\-codedeploy\-app**\.

1. In **Deployment groups**, choose the deployment group you created in [Tutorial: Deploy an Amazon ECS Service](tutorial-ecs-deployment.md)\. If you used the suggested name, it is **ecs\-demo\-dg**\.

1.  Choose **Edit**\. 

1. From **Test listener port**, choose the port and protocol for the test listener you created earlier in this tutorial\. This should be **HTTP: 8080**\. 

1.  Choose **Save changes**\. 

**To deploy your Amazon ECS application**

1. From your deployment group console page, choose **Create deployment**\.

1.  For **Deployment group**, choose **ecs\-demo\-dg**\. 

1.  For **Revision type**, choose **My application is stored in Amazon S3**\. In **Revision location**, enter the name of your S3 bucket and AppSpec file \(for example, **s3://my\-s3\-bucket/appspec\.json**\)\. 

1.  For **Revision file type**, choose **\.json** or **\.yaml** as appropriate\. 

1.  \(Optional\) In **Deployment description**, enter a description for your deployment\. 

1. Choose **Create deployment**\.

 You can monitor your deployment in **Deployment status**\. After 100% of production traffic is routed to the replacement task set, you can choose **Terminate original task set** to immediately terminate the original task set\. If you do not choose **Terminate original task set**, the original task set terminates after the duration you specified when you created your deployment group\.
