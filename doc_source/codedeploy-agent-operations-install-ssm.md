**Note**  
Make sure that the instance's operating system is also supported by the CodeDeploy agent\. For more information, see [Operating systems supported by the CodeDeploy agent](codedeploy-agent.md#codedeploy-agent-supported-operating-systems)\.

For information about installing or updating SSM agent on an instance running Linux, see [Installing and configuring the SSM agent on Linux instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-install-ssm-agent.html) in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide*\.

For information about installing or updating SSM agent on an instance running Windows Server, see [ Installing and configuring SSM agent on Windows instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-install-ssm-win.html) in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide*\.

### \(Optional\) Verify Systems Manager prerequisites<a name="install-codedeploy-agent-minimum-requirements"></a>
