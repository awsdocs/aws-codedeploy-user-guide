To view instance details:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS CodeDeploy console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/codedeploy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy)\.
**Note**  
Sign in with the same account or IAM user information you used in [Getting Started with AWS CodeDeploy](getting-started-codedeploy.md)\.

1. On the AWS CodeDeploy menu, choose **Deployments**\. 
**Note**  
If no entries are displayed, make sure the correct region is selected\. On the navigation bar, in the region selector, choose one of the regions listed in [Region and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#codedeploy_region) in the *AWS General Reference*\. AWS CodeDeploy is supported in these regions only\.

1. To see information about individual deployment lifecycle events for an instance, on the deployment details page, in the **Events** column, choose **View events**\. 
**Note**  
If **Failed** is displayed for any of the lifecycle events, on the instance details page, choose **View logs**, **View in EC2**, or both\. You can find troubleshooting tips in [Troubleshoot Instance Issues](troubleshooting-ec2-instances.md)\.

1. If you want to see more information about an Amazon EC2 instance, but **View in EC2** is not available on the instance details page, return to the deployment details page, and in the **Instance ID** column, choose the ID of the Amazon EC2 instance\.
