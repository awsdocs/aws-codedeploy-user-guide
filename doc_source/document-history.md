| Change | Description | Date Changed | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Topic updates | CodeDeploy is now available in the EU \(Paris\) Region \(eu\-west\-3\) region\. Several topics, including those containing instructions for setting up the CodeDeploy agent, were updated to reflect the availability of this new region\. | December 19, 2017 | 
| Updated topics |  CodeDeploy is now available in the China \(Ningxia\) Region\. To use services in the China \(Beijing\) Region or China \(Ningxia\) Region, you must have an account and credentials for those regions\. Accounts and credentials for other AWS regions do not work for the Beijing and Ningxia Regions, and vice versa\. Information about some resources for the China Regions, such as CodeDeploy Resource Kit bucket names and CodeDeploy agent installation procedures, are not included in this edition of the *CodeDeploy User Guide*\. For more information: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/document-history.html)  | December 11, 2017 | 
| Updated topics | CodeDeploy now supports the deployment of a Lambda function\. An AWS Lambda deployment shifts incoming traffic from an existing Lambda function to an updated Lambda function version\. You choose or create a deployment configuration to specify the number of traffic shifting intervals in the deployment and the percentage of traffic to shift in each interval\. AWS Lambda deployments are supported by the AWS Serverless Application Model \(AWS SAM\) so that you can use an AWS SAM deployment preference to manage the way in which traffic is shifted durng an AWS Lambda deployment\. Several topics have been added and updated to reflect this change, including [Overview of CodeDeploy Compute Platforms](welcome.md#compute-platform), [Deployments on an AWS Lambda Compute Platform](deployment-steps-lambda.md), [Create an AWS Lambda Compute Platform Deployment \(Console\)](deployments-create-console-lambda.md), [ Create an Application for an AWS Lambda Function Deployment \(Console\)](applications-create-lambda.md), and [Add an AppSpec File for an AWS Lambda Deployment](application-revisions-appspec-file.md#add-appspec-file-lambda)\.  |  November 28, 2017  | 
|  New topic  | CodeDeploy now supports deployments directly to a local machine or instance where the CodeDeploy Agent is installed\. You can locally test a deployment and, if it has errors, use CodeDeploy Agent error logs to debug them\. You can also use a local deployment to test the integrity of an application revision, the contents of an AppSpec file, and more\. For more information, see [Use the CodeDeploy Agent to Validate a Deployment Package on a Local Machine](deployments-local.md)\. |  November 16, 2017  | 
|  Updated topics  |  CodeDeploy support for Elastic Load Balancing load balancers in deployment groups has been expanded to include Network Load Balancers for both blue/green deployments and in\-place deployments\. You can now choose an Application Load Balancer, Classic Load Balancer, or Network Load Balancer for your deployment group\. Load balancers are required for blue/green deployments and optional for in\-place deployments\. A number of topics have been updated to reflect this support, including [Integrating CodeDeploy with Elastic Load Balancing](integrations-aws-elastic-load-balancing.md), [Create an Application for an In\-Place Deployment \(Console\)](applications-create-in-place.md), [Deployment Prerequisites](deployments-create-prerequisites.md), [Integrating CodeDeploy with Elastic Load Balancing](integrations-aws-elastic-load-balancing.md), and [Create an Application for an In\-Place Deployment \(Console\)](applications-create-in-place.md)\.  |  September 12, 2017  | 
|  Updated topics  |  CodeDeploy support for Elastic Load Balancing load balancers in deployment groups has been expanded to include Application Load Balancers for both blue/green deployments and in\-place deployments\. You can now choose between an Application Load Balancer and a Classic Load Balancer for your deployment group\. Load balancers are required for blue/green deployments, and optional for in\-place deployments\. Topics including [Integrating CodeDeploy with Elastic Load Balancing](integrations-aws-elastic-load-balancing.md), [Create an Application with CodeDeploy](applications-create.md), and [Create a Deployment Group with CodeDeploy](deployment-groups-create.md) have been updated to reflect this additional support\.  |  August 10, 2017  | 
| New and updated topics | CodeDeploy now supports using multiple tag groups to identify unions and intersections of instances to be included in a deployment group\. If you use a single tag group, any instance identified by at least one tag in the group is included in the deployment group\. If you use multiple tag groups, only instances that are identified by at least one tag in each of the tag groups are included\. For information about the new method for adding instances to a deployment group, see [Tagging Instances for Deployment Groups in CodeDeploy](instances-tagging.md)\. Other topics updated to reflect this support include [Create an Application for an In\-Place Deployment \(Console\)](applications-create-in-place.md), [Create an Application for a Blue/Green Deployment \(Console\)](applications-create-blue-green.md), [Create a Deployment Group for an In\-Place Deployment \(Console\)](deployment-groups-create-in-place.md), [Create a Deployment Group for an EC2/On\-Premises Blue/Green Deployment \(Console\)](deployment-groups-create-blue-green.md), [CodeDeploy Deployments](deployment-steps.md), and [Step 5: Create an Application and Deployment Group](tutorials-github-create-application.md) in [Tutorial: Use CodeDeploy to Deploy an Application from GitHub](tutorials-github.md)\.  | July 31, 2017 | 
| Updated topic | Two additional methods for installing the CodeDeploy agent on Windows Server instances have been added to [Install or reinstall the CodeDeploy agent for Windows Server](codedeploy-agent-operations-install-windows.md)\.

After the file is downloaded or copied to an instance, you can run the installation manually\. | July 12, 2017 | 
| Updated topics |  CodeDeploy has improved how it manages connections to GitHub accounts and repositories\. You can now create and store up to 25 connections to GitHub accounts in order to associate CodeDeploy applications with GitHub repositories\. Each connection can support multiple repositories\. You can create connections to up to 25 different GitHub accounts, or create more than one connection to a single account\. After you connect an application to a GitHub account, CodeDeploy manages the required access permissions without requiring any further action from you\. Updates to reflect this support have been made to [Specify Information About a Revision Stored in a GitHub Repository](deployments-create-console-github.md), [Integrating CodeDeploy with GitHub](integrations-partners-github.md), and [Tutorial: Use CodeDeploy to Deploy an Application from GitHub](tutorials-github.md)\.  | May 30, 2017 | 
| Updated topics |  In the past, if the CodeDeploy agent detected files in a target location that weren't part of the application revision from the most recent successful deployment, it would fail the current deployment by default\. CodeDeploy now provides options for how the agent handles these files: fail the deployment, retain the content, or overwrite the content\. [Create a Deployment with CodeDeploy](deployments-create.md) was updated to reflect this support, and the new section [Rollback Behavior with Existing Content](deployments-rollback-and-redeploy.md#deployments-rollback-and-redeploy-content-options) was added to [Redeploy and Roll Back a Deployment with CodeDeploy](deployments-rollback-and-redeploy.md)\.  | May 16, 2017 | 
| Updated topics |  A Classic Load Balancer in Elastic Load Balancing can now be assigned to a deployment group using the CodeDeploy console or AWS CLI\. During an in\-place deployment, a load balancer prevents internet traffic from being routed to an instance while it is being deployed to, and then makes the instance available for traffic again once the deployment to that instance completes\. Several topics were updated to reflect this new support, including [Integration with Other AWS Services](integrations-aws.md), [Integrating CodeDeploy with Elastic Load Balancing](integrations-aws-elastic-load-balancing.md), [Create an Application for an In\-Place Deployment \(Console\)](applications-create-in-place.md), [Create a Deployment Group for an In\-Place Deployment \(Console\)](deployment-groups-create-in-place.md), and [AppSpec 'hooks' Section](reference-appspec-file-structure-hooks.md)\.
