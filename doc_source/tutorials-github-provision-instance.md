# Step 4: Provision an Instance<a name="tutorials-github-provision-instance"></a>

In this step, you will create or configure the instance that you will deploy the sample application to\. You can deploy to an Amazon EC2 instance or an on\-premises instance that is running one of the operating systems supported by CodeDeploy\. For information see [Operating Systems Supported by the CodeDeploy Agent](codedeploy-agent.md#codedeploy-agent-supported-operating-systems)\. \(If you already have an instance configured for use in CodeDeploy deployments, skip to the next step\.\)

To create or configure an instance, see [Working with Instances for CodeDeploy](instances-ec2-create.md), and then return to this page\. 

**Note**  
To quickly create a new instance for this tutorial, we recommend using the Amazon EC2 console\. See [Launch an Amazon EC2 Instance \(Console\)](instances-ec2-create.md#instances-ec2-create-console)\.

To verify that the CodeDeploy agent is running on the instance, see [Verify the CodeDeploy Agent Is Running](codedeploy-agent-operations-verify.md)\.

After you have successfully launched or configured the instance and verified the CodeDeploy agent is running, go to the next step\.
